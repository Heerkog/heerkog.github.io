It supports function typing, function parameter nesting, function generics, higher functions and a range of update functions with an extensible framework allowing to add more context-specific functions. Feel free to contact me for more information." %}
{% include double-column-section-right.html topic="BPM Verification" icon="fa-file-circle-check" link="https://github.com/rug-ds-lab/BPMVerification" text="The business process verification package provides generic verification tools for Petri net based business process models. The package provides functionality for the gGeneration of a declarative process specification describing the common behavior of one or more related pnml process model variants and verification of a pnml process model against a generated or custom specification using the NuSMV2/NuXMV model checker." %}
