abstract = {State of the art design-time compliance checking techniques are generally limited to verifying control-flow relations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for verifying design-time compliance of business process models including data. For a faithful resemblance to real-world cases, we include a degree of uncertainty in the outcomes of activities, such that a single execution is not guaranteed to lead to a unique data state. We represent the compliance requirements using conditional obligations. Our proposed approach uses a symbolic representation to compactly represent the possible data states across an execution, and evaluates them as a constraint satisfaction problem to first prune the state space of paths that require no further analysis and finally to evaluate if an execution violates one of the regulatory requirements. The performance of the approach is evaluated against existing algorithms implemented in NuXMV. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the existing algorithms across the board.}

  title     = {Managing and Anticipating Out-of-Order Events in Online Compliance Monitoring},
  abstract  = {When monitoring compliance of event streams at runtime, it is usually assumed that the events are received in the order in which they are produced. However, in reality, event data is typically transmitted from distributed sources and may be received out-of-order as a result. This is problematic for the compliance analysis in terms of accuracy, latency and computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an approach to manage these problems by exploiting knowledge of the event sources to identify the reliable prefix of the event stream that is guaranteed to be in order, allowing a reliable analysis on that prefix. Subsequently, we use the prefix alignment of the observed event stream and a process model to quantify its reliability and identify events that might arrive out-of-order, allowing to calculate a confidence score of compliance results. This improves efficiency and provides compliance results with awareness of potential uncertainty, enabling decision makers to respond appropriately to the identified issues.},

abstract = {Organizations use business process management systems to automate processes that they use to perform tasks or interact with customers. However, several variants of the same business process may exist due to, e.g., mergers, customer-tailored services, diverse market segments, or distinct legislation across borders. As a result, reliable support for process variability has been identified as a necessity. In this article, we introduce the concept of declarative process families to support process variability and present a procedure to formally verify whether a business process model is part of a specified process family. The procedure allows to identify potential parts in the process that violate the process family. By introducing the concept of process families, we allow organizations to deviate from their prescribed processes using normal process model notation and automatically verify if such a deviation is allowed. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, a simple example process is used that describes several variants of a car rental process which is required to adhere to several process families. Moreover, to support the proposed procedure, we present a tool that allows business processes, specified as Petri nets, to be verified against their declarative process families using the NuSMV2 model checker.}

  title={Cross-Instance Regulatory Compliance Checking of Business Process Event Logs}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Event logs capture the execution of business processes, such that each task is represented by an event and each individual execution is a chronological sequence of events, called an event trace. Event logs allow after-the-act and runtime analysis of deployed business processes to verify whether their execution complies with regulations and business requirements. Checking the compliance of a single sequence of events in a trace is straightforward and a number of approaches have been proposed to address this. However, some regulations or business rules span multiple process instances and a cross-instance analysis is required. In order to check whether such requirements are maintained at all times, multiple traces need to be analysed together, which can result in a combinatorial computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel approach that efficiently checks runtime regulatory compliance based on event logs, while supporting cross-instance rule evaluation and extensible function evaluation over sequences of attribute data values. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed method is tested in a two-pronged evaluation, showing a significant improvement over existing techniques with respect to capabilities as well as computational complexity. The approach presented in this paper is subject to a patent application, with patent number WO2021/248201.},

    abstract="A wealth of techniques have been developed to help organizations understand their processes, verify correctness against requirements and diagnose potential problems. In general, these verification techniques allow us to check whether a business process conforms or complies with some specification, and each of them is specifically designed to solve a particular business problem at a stage of the BPM lifecycle. However, the terms conformance and compliance are often used as synonyms and their distinct differences in verification goals is blurring. As a result, the terminology used to describe the techniques or the corresponding verification activity does not always match with the precise meaning of the terms as they are defined in the area of verification. Consequently, confusion of these terms may hamper the application of the different techniques and the correct positioning of research. In this position paper, we aim to provide comprehensive definitions and a unified terminology throughout the BPM lifecycle. Moreover, we explore the consequences when these terms are used incorrectly. In doing so, we aim to improve adoption from research to practical applications by clarifying the relation between techniques and the intended verification goals.",

The computer creates a stream of log events, wherein the stream is sorted by the event time. The computer iterates over the stream of log events, and for each log event, executes update functions that define updates of a set of variables based on the log events. The set of variables comprises at least one cross-trace variable to calculate an updated value of the set of variables. The update functions define updates of the cross-trace variable in response to the log events of the traces. The computer further executes evaluation functions on the set of variables to determine compliance in relation to the log data based on the updated value. The evaluation functions represent compliance rules based on the set of variables including the cross-trace variable.},
